//Any code in part1.js is still accessible in this file! 
//Try it out. See if you can console.log a variable from part1 (like animals) from this page.

//1a: Log the Animal Personal Data
//Choose which animal you want for your profile page, select it from your animals collection and save it in a variable called profileAnimal.
var profileAnimal = animals[0];
console.log(profileAnimal);

//Loop through the properties of the animal, console.log the property name and if the property value is a string, also print that out. If the value is not a string, then just put a placeholder value of 'click here for data' (not actually a link)
//'species: dog, tagline: who let the dogs out?, noises: click here for more data, relationships: click here for more data' etc
for(var i = 0; i === animal.species; i++) {
     
}


//Adjust the previous loop so that it will loop through the noises array and print it out like this:
//'species: dog, tagline: who let the dogs out?, noises: woof bark slurp , relationships: click here for more data'
